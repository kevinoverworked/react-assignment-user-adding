# react-learning-user-adding
This is a part of my Udemy React Learning course. Goals here are to fill out a form for username and age, on submit check it for improper values. If improper values are found, open a modal with messaging. If values are correct, add it to a list component.

For this lesson we were encouraged to try it out on our own and then compare to the teacher's solution. I was successful at getting it to work and match what the teacher had.
